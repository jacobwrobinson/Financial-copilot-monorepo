# `validation/` – AI Validation Router

## Overview
This module acts as a simple router that leverages the chatbot's AI capabilities to validate financial analysis outputs. It's a lightweight orchestrator that passes all validation logic to the AI, avoiding duplicate logic and complexity.

## Goals
- Route outputs to AI for comprehensive validation.
- Leverage AI reasoning for flexible, context-aware validation.
- Ensure outputs are consistent, appropriate, and trustworthy.
- Keep validation logic centralized in the chatbot module.

## Responsibilities
- Route analysis outputs to the chatbot module for AI-based validation.
- Handle validation requests and responses between modules.
- Return validated (and potentially corrected) outputs to the output module.

## Planned Structure
- `validator.py`: Simple validation router/orchestrator.
- `interfaces/`: API contracts for chatbot communication.
- `prompts/`: Validation prompt templates for different scenarios.
- `tests/`: Integration tests for validation flow.

## How It Works
1. **Receive Output**: Accept analysis results from other modules
2. **Route to AI**: Send output to chatbot with validation prompt
3. **Process Response**: Handle AI feedback (validated, corrected, or flagged)
4. **Return Result**: Send AI-validated output to the output module

## Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] Create simple routing interface with chatbot module.
- [ ] Design AI validation prompts for different output types.
- [ ] Implement request/response handling.
- [ ] Add integration tests with chatbot and output modules.

## Why Pure AI Validation?
- **No Duplicate Logic**: All validation intelligence stays in the chatbot
- **Contextually Smart**: AI understands format, structure, logic, and appropriateness
- **Self-Healing**: AI can fix issues rather than just flagging them
- **Ultra-Simple**: Module is just a router - no complex validation code to maintain
- **Future-Proof**: Automatically improves as AI models advance

## Example Flow
```
Financial Analysis → Validation Router → 
Chatbot ("Review this analysis for accuracy, completeness, and professionalism") → 
Validated/Corrected Output → Output Module → User
```

## Notes
This module is intentionally minimal - it's a pure router that delegates all validation intelligence to the AI. This avoids code duplication while ensuring comprehensive, context-aware validation.
