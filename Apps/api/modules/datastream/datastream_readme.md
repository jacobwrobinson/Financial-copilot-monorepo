# `datastream/` â€“ Real-time Data Flow

## Overview
This module acts as the real-time data provider for the financial assistant. It handles pub/sub communication, sourcing and broadcasting data streams which feed into the analysis engine.

## Goals
- Provide a continuous stream of relevant financial data.
- Standardize and sanitize incoming data.
- Allow other modules (like knowledgebase and chatbot) to subscribe to specific data feeds.

## Responsibilities
- Set up data producers (e.g., APIs, simulators).
- Manage subscribers and brokers (e.g., Redis, Kafka).
- Ensure resilience and failover for data continuity.

## Planned Structure
- `producers/`: Modules fetching financial data.
- `subscribers/`: Interfaces listening to specific topics.
- `brokers/`: Middleware glue (Redis, Kafka, etc.).
- `utils/`: Message serialization, topic naming conventions.

## Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] Choose and set up pub/sub middleware.
- [ ] Define data topic schema.
- [ ] Build producer for mock financial data.
- [ ] Implement a sample subscriber pipeline.
- [ ] Add retry/backoff logic.

## Notes
This module feeds the knowledgebase with the data needed for dynamic analysis. Scalability and low-latency delivery are key priorities.
