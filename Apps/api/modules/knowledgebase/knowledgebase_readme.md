# `knowledgebase/` â€“ Contextual Financial Memory

## Overview
The `knowledgebase/` module serves as the contextual memory of the AI financial system. It stores domain-specific knowledge, analytical models, and historical context to support smart, context-aware responses.

## Goals
- Store vectorized knowledge about financial models, rules, and prior analyses.
- Enable semantic retrieval of relevant context.
- Augment AI prompts and outputs with deep financial context.

## Responsibilities
- Build and maintain a vector database (e.g., Chroma, FAISS).
- Provide interfaces to ingest, query, and update contextual knowledge.
- Return relevant chunks for prompt injection.

## Planned Structure
- `embeddings/`: Logic for embedding and storing docs.
- `retrievers/`: Query strategies and filtering.
- `models/`: Financial analysis logic and rule sets.
- `interfaces/`: APIs to serve context.

## Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] Set up vector DB and baseline schema.
- [ ] Build embedding pipeline.
- [ ] Add APIs to query relevant documents.
- [ ] Store financial model definitions and examples.
- [ ] Integrate with chatbot orchestration.

## Notes
This is the heart of financial intelligence in the system. Accuracy, fast retrieval, and maintainable updates are essential.
