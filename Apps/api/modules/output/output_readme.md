# `output/` – Output Formatting & Delivery

## Overview
The `output/` module is responsible for formatting final responses and dispatching them to the user interface. It ensures clarity, consistency, and channel-appropriate presentation.

## Goals
- Format analysis results into clean, structured messages.
- Support various output types (text, charts, summaries).
- Dispatch results through the frontend UI or other delivery channels.

## Responsibilities
- Apply formatting rules (e.g., markdown, rich cards).
- Determine delivery channel and method.
- Convert validated data into user-facing content.

## Planned Structure
- `formatters/`: Modules to style and shape outputs.
- `dispatchers/`: Channel-specific delivery logic.
- `templates/`: Message templates for various scenarios.
- `tests/`: Output quality and structure tests.

## Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] Define output formats (UI card, JSON blob, etc.).
- [ ] Build formatter for financial summaries.
- [ ] Add UI dispatch integration.
- [ ] Write fallback and error message logic.

## Notes
Presentation influences trust — this module should balance precision with user readability.
